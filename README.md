  This program is capable of encrypting and decrypting messages using the RSA Cryptosystem. It can encrypt and decrypt messages consisting of any ASCII character. The system can handle e and N values dozens of digits long. Messages are encrypted and decrypted into seperate files. In order to decrypt a message, it needs to be inside the encrypted text file.
